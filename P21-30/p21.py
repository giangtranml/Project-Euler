    Amicable numbers

    Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
    If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

    For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
        therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

    Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The idea:
    - Init an array with the length is 10000, the index in array represents
    for n, and the value at that index n is d(n).
    - For each number in range(10000 -> 1): (corresponding the index of array)
        -- find proper divisors of that number, name pd
        -- if that number > length 10000, then move to the next number
        -- if value of arr[pd] == num, then add it to the sum
        -- assign pd at that index.
