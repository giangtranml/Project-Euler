    Name: Largest palindrome product.

    A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
    The largest palindrome made from the product of
            two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

    Find the largest palindrome made from the product
            of two 3-digit numbers.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    A palindromic number is a number that its original and reversed is
                equal.
